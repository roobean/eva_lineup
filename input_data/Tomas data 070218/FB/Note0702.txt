In room 1.24, we ran H&S and FB. Administrator saved 8 participants as subjects 1 to 8.
At the end of data collection, the administrator went through post-id qnrs and found the missing
participant IDs.
We checked post-id qnrs and were left with 4 H&S and 4 FB forms that had no files, 
and based on the decisions and answers from post-ID qnrs found the subject nr and renamed all 8 files.

H&S:
1=57
2=59
3=54
4=76

FB:
5=78
6=62
7=61
8=63
